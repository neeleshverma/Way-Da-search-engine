# Way-Da-search-engine

This is just a very basic search engine, although it can be enhanced in various ways by having more database for web-pages, or through some parsing algorithms.

**Crawler** :- Contains the spider bot that crawls through the links. We have started with some basic links. The crawler goes through these links and find other links there, add those to the database and explore them later.

**fillDatabase** :- Database is filled with attributes like pageId (webpage id), heading 1, url, some important words that we have extracted from headings.

**userQuery** :- This is the UI that is presented to the user where the user will enter the query.
